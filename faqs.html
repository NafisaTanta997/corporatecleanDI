<!--   <h2>FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions)</h2> -->
<section id="faqs">
  <div class="questions">
    <dl>
      <dt>What products or services offered by Corporate Cean?</dt>
      <dd>The actual product is the consulting advice we offer to companies about how to become more eco-friendly. We provide an analysis of what the company is doing that is harming the environment and their wallets. We then construct a plan of action unique to each individual for how they are able to save money while taking on more eco-friendly habits.</dd>
      <dt>What is the pricing stategy for products and services?</dt>
      <dd> Our pricing depends on the customer/ business themselves. Depending on how much action is needed to be taken, the price will change as well. We would charge a flat rate depending how much of the building the client’s company occupies or the square footage of the company depending on the type of client.
</dd>

      <dt>Will promotions be offered?</dt>
      <dd>While we will have some social media handles to expand our networks, our main promotion will occur through cold-calling. We will also offer 10% discounts for the first few businesses we work with. We would also attempt to work with and receive endorsement from the NYC Department of Buildings and the Department of Environmental Protection.
</dd>
      <dt>Where will the product or service take place?</dt>
      <dd>The workers are the place. Consultants or advisors would go to the companies to observe how the company has been managing energy usage and how to make it better. We would at first have senior advisors communicate with potential clients over the phone and then visit the client’s office.
</dd>
      <dt>Who are the people that work at Corporate Clean?</dt>
      <dd>Our business would mostly consist of consultants interested in helping the environment and helping the client reduce expenses. Therefore our employees would need to be willing to build long term relationships, communicate to the correct authority figures and provide weekly/ bi-weekly analysis (depending on the customers preference) of the companies performance. We want our customers to know our main goal is to help their business and help the environment. 
</dd>
      <dt>Is there a long-term contract for services or products?</dt>
      <dd>No, our services and products are provided to suit your companies needs. There are no long-term contract obligations.</dd>

      <dt>Can I skip or reschedule an appointment?</dt>
      <dd>If you anticipate needing to change an appointment time, please let us know in advance. We'll move your appointment to a more convenient time, or cancel altogether if needed. </dd>
